I have used all parameters given to me, string variables I transformed to numeric, and used RandomForestRegressor to predict house prices. It gave me 16808 points on kaggle.com in the house's price competition and placed me in the 33000th position in the leaderboard (at this moment competition has 67000 participants). I will try to improve my prediction by playing with parameters and using other prediction models

Using GradientBoostingRegressor gave 16125 points which placed me in the 4300th position
